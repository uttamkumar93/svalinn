Core Principles (Encouraged):
  - Respect for emotional and creative lineage
  - Transparent AI training practices with explicit consent
  - Preservation of metadata and attribution
  - Protection of narrative intent and cultural context

The Palimpsest principles represent our vision for a consent-based internet.
While not legally binding for use of this software, we encourage all users
and contributors to familiarize themselves with these principles.
