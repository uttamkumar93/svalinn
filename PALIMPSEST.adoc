== Legal Status

This project is legally licensed under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**.

The Palimpsest Licence is a philosophical and ethical framework that accompanies the legal license. **Palimpsest does not currently provide legal protections** - it is a manifesto and a set of principles that we encourage adopters to embrace alongside the MPL-2.0.

== Why MPL-2.0 + Palimpsest?

=== The Legal Foundation: MPL-2.0

The Mozilla Public License 2.0 provides:

* **File-level copyleft** - modifications to MPL-licensed files must remain open
* **Compatibility** - can be combined with proprietary code and other open source licenses
* **Patent protection** - includes explicit patent grants
* **Clear, modern language** - well-drafted and widely understood

=== The Philosophical Layer: Palimpsest

Palimpsest adds an ethical dimension that legal licenses cannot capture:

* **Layered contribution** - like a palimpsest manuscript, each contributor adds to what came before
* **Transparent provenance** - clear attribution of ideas, not just code
* **Collaborative evolution** - encouraging forks that improve rather than fragment
* **Ethical use guidelines** - principles beyond what law can enforce

== Future Direction

**Palimpsest v0.5** will integrate MPL-2.0 and Palimpsest principles into a single, legally recognized license. This work is ongoing.

Until then:

1. **MPL-2.0** is the legally binding license for this project
2. **Palimpsest** is the philosophical framework we encourage you to adopt
3. Distributing Palimpsest alongside your use of this code is encouraged but not required

== Get Involved

We are actively developing Palimpsest as a real, legally recognized license that captures both the legal and ethical dimensions of open source collaboration.

If you are interested in:

* Contributing to the Palimpsest license design
* Adopting Palimpsest for your own projects
* Providing legal expertise on open source licensing
* Discussing the philosophy behind Palimpsest

**Please get in touch:**

* GitHub: https://github.com/hyperpolymath
* Palimpsest Licence repo: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/palimpsest-licence

== Signing Up to Palimpsest

While Palimpsest is not yet legally formalized, you can signal your support by:

1. Adding the Palimpsest badge to your project README
2. Including `PALIMPSEST.adoc` in your repository
3. Mentioning Palimpsest in your LICENSE file
4. Joining discussions about the license's development
